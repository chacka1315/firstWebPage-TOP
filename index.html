                <img src="/assets/img1.jpg" alt="Yacht picture">
                <div>As many as eight yachts have been named Aurora, 
                    with a few others sporting a variation of the name. 
                    Perhaps inspired by the aurora borealis or northern lights, 
                    this moniker was chosen by the owners of both the 74 metre Lürssen and the 
                    49.9 metre from Rossinavi, which were both launched in the same year.

                <div>Another highly popular superyacht name is Escape — a fitting title for the place where many owners go to get 
                    away from the stresses of the modern world. At least eight yachts bear this exact name and many more use variations 
                    on the theme, such as Sweet Escape and Magnificent Escape.

                <div> Some believe that they were always fated to own a yacht, and that certainly seems to be the case with this 37.3 metre Heesen. Her name, Her Destiny, 
                    is a variant of one of the most popular superyacht names, with 10 other yachts in our database going by a similar name.

                <div>At the top of our list, and surely a strong contender for the world's most popular superyacht name, is Freedom. There are 17 entries in the superyacht directory for this name, which is hardly surprising as that is exactly what many owners crave from their yachting experience. The largest superyacht called Freedom is a 70 metre built by Italian yard Benetti, pictured above.At the top of our list, and surely a strong contender for the world’s most popular superyacht name, is Freedom.
